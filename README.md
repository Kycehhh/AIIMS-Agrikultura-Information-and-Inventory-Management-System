## Overview

The **Agrikultura Information and Inventory Management System (AIIMS)** is a comprehensive inventory monitoring and management system designed for the Agrikultura Market. This system provides a user-friendly interface for inventory managers to perform various tasks, including displaying, sorting, creating, updating, and removing product records. The system also allows the generation of different types of inventory reports. The primary goal of AIIMS is to streamline inventory processes, improve accuracy, and enhance efficiency in inventory management.

## Features

- **User Authentication**: Login system for authorized access.
- **Inventory Management**: Functions to display, sort, create, update, delete, and manage inventory records.
- **Product Management**: Ability to manage products that are low in stock, expired, or sold.
- **Report Generation**: Generation of various reports such as product records, replenishing, removal, and sold products reports.

## Test Plan

The purpose of the test plan is to ensure that AIIMS meets all specified requirements and functions correctly. The test plan includes the following sections:

### 1. Test Strategy

The test strategy defines the approach to testing the AIIMS. It includes:

- **Unit Testing**: To verify that individual components function correctly.
- **System Testing**: To validate that the complete system meets the intended requirements.
- **User Acceptance Testing (UAT)**: To ensure that the application meets the end user's expectations.

### 2. Scope of Testing

- **Features to be Tested**: All core functionalities such as login, inventory management, sorting, creating/updating records, replenishing/removing products, and report generation.
- **Features Not to be Tested**: User interfaces, hardware interfaces, software interfaces, and database logic.

### 3. Risk and Issues

Risks associated with the testing process include limited testing experience, time constraints, external responsibilities, and communication issues with the client. Mitigation strategies are outlined in the plan to address these risks.

### 4. Test Logistics

- **Who Will Test?**: Unit and system tests will be conducted by the development team. UAT will be performed by third-party testers.
- **When Will Testing Occur?**: Testing will begin once the software is ready, test specifications are prepared, the environment is set up, and testers are available.

### 5. Test Objectives

The objectives of testing are to ensure that the software meets functional requirements, performs well under different load conditions, is user-friendly, and meets end-user expectations.

### 6. Test Criteria

- **Suspension Criteria**: Testing will be halted if critical defects are identified, software frequently crashes, or other significant issues occur.
- **Exit Criteria**: Testing will be considered complete when all test cases are executed and meet the required pass rate.

### 7. Resources and Environment

- **System Requirements**: At least one computer running Windows 7 or later with a minimum of 4GB RAM.
- **Test Deliverables**: Documents produced before, during, and after testing, including test plans, test cases, test tools, test data, test results, defect reports, and release notes.
